## About

This is the seventh project of the Google Front-End Nanodegree Program. 

In the MyReads project, we have to create a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that we will use to persist information as we interact with the application.
